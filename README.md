# react-code-splitting

A simple concept that can bring great performance results to ReactJS applications.

## Overview

This project demonstrates techniques for code splitting in React, which can significantly enhance the performance of your React applications. By splitting your code, you can load only the necessary parts of your application when they are needed, reducing the initial load time and improving the user experience.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-code-splitting.git
cd react-code-splitting
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the project locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Techniques Covered

- **Dynamic Importing:** Load components only when they are required.
- **React.lazy and Suspense:** Simplify code splitting with built-in React features.
- **Route-based Splitting:** Split code based on route changes using `react-router`.

## Examples

Here are some examples of code splitting techniques used in this project:

### Dynamic Importing

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const DynamicComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./DynamicComponent'));

const App = () => {
  return (
    <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <DynamicComponent />
    </React.Suspense>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Route-based Splitting

```jsx
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

const Home = lazy(() => import('./Home'));
const About = lazy(() => import('./About'));

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <Switch>
          <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
          <Route path="/about" component={About} />
        </Switch>
      </Suspense>
    </Router>
  );
};

export default App;
```
